## Welcome to optimanetworks/onx

### This is a public repository of tools to use on all ONX systems.

---

In order to always provide up-to-date scripts for specific tasks that work on all current ONX devices, we're launching this repository to make things easier.
Though this page is currently under construction, you will find one-line commands for configuration scripts below.

The idea is that these tools can be used on any ONX device running Ubuntu, Windows installations will __not__ be supported.

Example one-line command:
> `bash <(curl -s https://raw.github.com/optimanetworks/onx/)`
